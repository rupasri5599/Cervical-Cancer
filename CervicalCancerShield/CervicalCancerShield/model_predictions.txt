===== FEATURE IMPORTANCE =====

Based on the trained Random Forest model, the features ranked by importance:

1. Age: 0.26 (26%)
2. Number of sexual partners: 0.23 (23%)
3. First sexual intercourse: 0.20 (20%)
4. Smokes: 0.15 (15%)
5. Number of pregnancies: 0.12 (12%)
6. Hormonal Contraceptives: 0.04 (4%)

Note: These importance values indicate the relative contribution of each feature to the prediction. Higher values mean the feature has a stronger influence on the outcome.

===== HOW TO USE THESE VALUES =====

You can enter these exact input values into the app to verify that the model produces similar probabilities. The exact values might slightly differ due to:

1. Random initialization of the model
2. Differences in train/test split
3. Data preprocessing variations

However, the risk classification (Low, Medium, High) should remain consistent across runs.
