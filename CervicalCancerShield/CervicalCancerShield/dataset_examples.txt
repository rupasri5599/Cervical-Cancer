===== OBSERVED PATTERNS =====

From the dataset, several patterns emerge that correspond to higher cervical cancer risk:

1. Higher age (especially above 40)
2. Earlier age at first sexual intercourse (below 17)
3. Higher number of pregnancies (4 or more)
4. Smoking
5. Not using hormonal contraceptives (which appear to have a protective effect)

These patterns align with known medical risk factors for cervical cancer and are captured by the prediction model.
