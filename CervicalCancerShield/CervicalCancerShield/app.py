    ### What is Cervical Cancer?
    
    Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix ‚Äî the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.
    
    Various strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer.
    
    When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years, contributing to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.
    
    ### Risk Factors
    
    Several risk factors may increase your chance of developing cervical cancer:
    
    - **Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection**: This is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer.
    - **Smoking**: Women who smoke are about twice as likely as non-smokers to get cervical cancer.
    - **Having a weakened immune system**: Conditions like HIV/AIDS or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increase risk.
    - **Sexual history**: Having multiple sexual partners, becoming sexually active at a young age, or having other sexually transmitted infections.
    - **Using oral contraceptives for a long time**: Using birth control pills for 5 or more years may slightly increase risk.
    - **Having many full-term pregnancies**: Women who have had 3 or more full-term pregnancies have an increased risk.
    
    ### Prevention
    
    To reduce your risk of cervical cancer:
    
    - **Get vaccinated against HPV**: The HPV vaccine is recommended for preteens and teens.
    - **Have regular Pap tests**: Pap tests can detect precancerous conditions of the cervix, allowing them to be treated before cancer develops.
    - **Practice safe sex**: Using condoms during sex helps reduce the risk of HPV and other STIs.
    - **Don't smoke**: If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, quit.
    
    ### Early Detection
    
    Regular screening is crucial for early detection of cervical cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends:
    
    - Pap test every 3 years for women ages 21 to 29
    - Pap test and HPV test (co-testing) every 5 years or a Pap test alone every 3 years for women ages 30 to 65
    
    ### When to See a Doctor
    
    Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience:
    
    - Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause
    - Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor
    - Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse
    
    Remember, cervical cancer is highly preventable with regular screening tests and follow-up care.
